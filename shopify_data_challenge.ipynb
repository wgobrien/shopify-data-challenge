To install Jupyter Notebook, you can run the command 'pip install notebook' in terminal, and start the program by running 'jupyter notebook'.

    "On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",

    "- Think about a better way to evaluate this data. \n",
